The average age of terminated cases in 2019 was 255 days, slightly over the target of 215 days.  This overage is reflected in the Court's closure rate which was 130%, meaning more cases were closed than what were filed.</p>

          <p class="more-text">In FY 2019, the Court ensured its website provided current and easily accessible information describing legal options.  Forms were updated to allow for efficient mail/email communication including the financial affidavits necessary to determine eligibility for alternative sentencing options.  Court clerks responded to more than 300,000 inquiries via telephone and email, providing information on legal options, including alternative sentencing, available for individuals to address their cases.

		  Arrests on solely Class C misdemeanors decreased 32% in FY 2019.  2,554 people were arrested versus 3,751 people in the previous fiscal year.  For those arrested on both misdemeanors and felonies, only 28 defendants were remanded to jail.  This is a decrease of 46% from FY 2018, down from 51 defendants.

          <p class="more-text">In FY 2019, 47,400 cases (22% of cases filed at the court) were placed on payment plans and given extensions of time to pay. In addition, 2,255 cases - over $480,000 in fines, costs, and fees - were satisfied entirely or partially with community service credit.</p>

          <p class="additional-text">Minimize the issuance of warrants whenever alternatives are available and through the imposition of alternative sentences.</p>
          <p class="more-text">In FY 2019, the court issued 29,388 warrants.  This signifies a 40% decrease from the previous fiscal year.  Two-thirds of the warrants issued were a result of defendants failing to appear in court. Of all warrants cleared in FY 2019, 93.4% were cleared by defendants contacting the court; only 6.6% were cleared due to an arrest.
        <br><br>
        While an overwhelming majority of cases are adjudicated within 60 days, the Court actively seeks to minimize adverse consequences such as collection fees, warrants and jail commitments on its cases.  The Court initiated over 330,000 contacts to remind citizens of upcoming court dates, due dates for proof or payment, or to notify them of delinquent cases.  All citations and delinquent notices included information on alternative sentencing options to facilitate compliance.

          <p class="more-text">In FY 2019, more than 11,000 cases received reductions or waivers of fines, costs, and fees.  This includes over 2,800 cases where indigency was determined.  As a result, almost $1.5 million was waived.
              <br><br>
              Citizens may be granted the opportunity to comply with court orders by performing community service or other non-monetary means of payment.  Alternative sentencing options resulted in non-monetary payments that totaled over $4,000,000.

          <p class="more-text"> The Austin Municipal Court judges provide magistration services at the Travis County Central Booking Facility by arraigning or magistrating all defendants on charges ranging from Class C misdemeanors to Capital felonies.  During this process, the judge will read the charge(s) to the defendant, and explain the penalties. The defendant is also advised of his/her right to trial, and, if applicable, the right to counsel (legal representation).
              The judge will then set the amount of bail or release the defendant on personal bond. <br><br>In FY 2019, 80% of those arrested were released on personal bonds.</p>

          <p class="more-text">In addition to the City of Austin's Annual Community Survey, the Court seeks immediate feedback from citizens visiting the Court. During FY 2019, 326 citizens participated in the Court's survey. Of those, 98% found their interaction with the Court satisfactory or above. Prospective jurors are also encouraged to complete a survey regarding their experience and interaction with the Court. Over 5,000 jurors took the survey with over 99% describing the process going "as expected" or better.
             <br><br>
            To further achieve the fair administration of justice, the Court partnered with the Texas Fair Defense Project and The University of Texas Law School on a quarterly basis to offer legal services and alternate access to the Court. During these clinics, citizens had the opportunity to consult with legal counsel free of charge in a neutral environment. As a result, 852 Department of Public Safety Surcharge Waivers were granted based on economic criteria.<br><br> In addition, the Court held a Warrant Amnesty program in which 9,274 warrants were cancelled and approximately $466,785 in warrant fees were waived.</p>
