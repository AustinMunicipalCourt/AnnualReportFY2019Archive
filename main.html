          <p class="more-text">In 2019, 73% of cases were adjudicated within 60 days of the filing date.  89% of cases were adjudicated within 180 - the standard deferred adjudication time period. The average age of terminated cases in 2019 was 255 days, slightly over the target of 215 days.  This overage is reflected in the Court's closure rate which was 130%, meaning we terminated more cases than what was filed with the Court in 2019.</p>

                    Over 300,000 contacts were made to the Court via email, telephonic and online communication.  All of these contacts from the public were answered by a court clerk who could explain all of the legal options available including alternative sentencing options.

          <p class="more-text">Arrests on solely Class C misdemeanors decreased 32% in 2019.  2,554 people were arrested in 2019 versus 3,751 people in 2018.  For all those arrested on both misdemeanors and felonies, only 28 defendants were remanded to jail.  This is a decrease of 46% from 2018, down from 51 defendants remanded in 2018.
              <br><br>
              While an overwhelming majority of cases are adjudicated within 60 days, the Court actively seeks to minimize adverse consquences such as collection fees, warrants and jail commitments on its cases.  The Court initiated over 330,000 contacts to remind citizens of upcoming court dates, due dates for proof or payment, or to notify them of delinquent cases.  All citations and delinquent notices included information on alternative sentencing options to facilitate compliance.

Two-thirds of the warrants issued were a result of defendants failing to appear in court. Of all warrants cleared in 2019, 93.4% of warrants were cleared by defendants contacting the court.  Only 6.6% of warrants were cleared due to an arrest.

          <p class="more-text">In 2019, over 11,000 cases received reductions or waivers of fines, costs, and fees.  This includes over 2,800 cases where indigency was determined.  As a result, almost $1.5 million was waived.
              <br><br>
              Citizens were granted the opportunity to comply with the Court by utilizing community service or other non-monetary means of payment.  Granting alternative sentencing options resulted in non-monetary payments that totaled over $4,000,000.  In addition, the Court's judges waived over $1,000,000 in judicial costs plus almost $400,000 of warrant fees during the Court's Warrant Amnesty event.

          <p class="more-text"> The Austin Municipal Court judges provide magistration services at the Travis County Central Booking Facility by arraigning or magistrating all defendants on charges ranging from Class C misdemeanors to Capital felonies.  During this process, the judge will read the charge(s) to the defendant, and explain the penalties. The defendant is also advised of his/her right to trial, and right to trial by jury if desired.
            If applicable, the right to counsel (legal representation) is explained, and the judge or magistrate appoints a lawyer if the defendant requests one and is found to be indigent (too poor to afford a private lawyer).  The judge will then set the amount of bail or release the defendant on personal bond. <br><br>In 2019, 80% of those arrested were released on personal bonds by Municipal Court judges.</p>

          <p class="more-text">In addition to the City of Austin's Annual Community Survey, the Court seeks immediate feedback from citizens visiting the Court. During Fiscal Year 2019, 326 citizens participated in the Court's survey. Of those, 98% found their interaction with the Court satisfactory or above. Prospective jurors are also encouraged to complete a survey regarding their experience and interaction with the Court. Over 5,000 jurors took the survey with over 99% describing the process going "as expected" or better.
             <br><br>
            To further achieve the fair adminstration of justice, the Court partnered with the Texas Fair Defense Project and The University of Texas Law School on a quarterly basis to offer legal services and alternate access to the Court. During these clinics, citizens had the opportunity to consult with legal counsel free of charge in a neutral environment. As a result, 852 DPS Surcharge Waivers were granted based on economic criteria.</p>
